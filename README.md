# Who am I?
I'm Jamie Blomerus, a web developer from Ã–rebro, Sweden, specializing in WordPress and accessibility in line with WCAG standards. My career includes roles from web developer at WCAG Networks to CEO and founder of Webbstart, focusing on secure, user-friendly web solutions. I'm fluent in Swedish and English, contributing to the WordPress community and plugins. I'm committed to sustainability in tech, actively involved with WPSustainable, a project aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of WordPress websites. My goal is to merge technical expertise with creative design for accessible, engaging, and environmentally responsible web experiences.
